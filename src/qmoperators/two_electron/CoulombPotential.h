/** @class CoulombPotential
 *
 * @brief Coulomb potential defined by a particular electron density
 *
 * The Coulomb potential is computed by application of the Poisson operator
 * an electron density. There are two ways of defining the density:
 *
 *  1) Use getDensity() prior to setup() and build the density as you like.
 *  2) Provide a default set of orbitals in the constructor that is used to
 *     compute the density on-the-fly in setup().
 *
 * If a set of orbitals has NOT been given in the constructor, the density
 * MUST be explicitly computed prior to setup(). The density will be computed
 * on-the-fly in setup() ONLY if it is not already available. After setup() the
 * operator will be fixed until clear(), which deletes both the density and the
 * potential.

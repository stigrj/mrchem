/** @class OrbitalOptimizer
 *
 * @brief Ground state SCF optimization with kinetic energy operator
 *
 * This ground state SCF solver computes the Fock matrix explicitly by application of
 * the kinetic energy operator. This simplifies the algorithm significanly when a KAIN
 * iterative accelerator is present, or when diagonalization/localization occurs.
 * The derivative operator in the kinetic energy MIGHT affect the quadratic precision
 * in the energy, but this point seems to no longer be critical.

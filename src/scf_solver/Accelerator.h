/** @class Acccelerator
 *
 *  Base class for iterative subspace accelerators for use in SCF
 *  optimizations. Solves a linear system of equations \f$ Ac = b \f$
 *  to obtain the coefficient vector \f$ c \f$ that gives the linear
 *  combination of history orbitals that gives the next iteration.
 *  The size of the problem (matrix A) is given by the length of the
 *  history (not the number of orbitals).
 *
 *  The form of the linear problem (how to compute A and b) is given
 *  in the subclass. It is possible to treat each orbital separately,
 *  but usually you will benefit from including all orbitals in the
 *  same subspace and solve for them simultaneously (default). It is
 *  also possible to include the Fock matrix and corresponding update
 *  to the subspace. In this case one entry is added (corresponding to
 *  an extra orbital) using the Frobenius inner product of matrices.

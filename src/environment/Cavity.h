/** @class Cavity
 * @brief Interlocking spheres cavity centered on the nuclei of the molecule.
 * The Cavity class represents the following function \cite Fosso-Tande2013
 * \f[
 *    C(\mathbf{r})   = 1 - \prod^N_{i=1} (1-C_i(\mathbf{r})) \\
 *    C_i(\mathbf{r}) = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 + \textrm{erf}\left(\frac{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i| -
 *    R_i}{\sigma}\right) \right)
 * \f]
 * where \f$\mathbf{r}\f$ is the coordinate of a point in 3D space, \f$\mathbf{r}_i\f$
 * is the coordinate of the i-th nucleus, \f$R_i\f$ is the radius of the i-th sphere, and \f$\sigma\f$ is the #width of
 * the transition between the inside and outside of the cavity. The transition has a sigmoidal shape, such that the
 * boundary is a smooth function instead of sharp boundaries often seen in other continuum models. This function is
 * \f$1\f$ inside and \f$0\f$ outside the cavity.
